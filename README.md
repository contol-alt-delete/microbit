# Microbit

This repository contains the code for the operating system that I'm developing called `Microbit`.

The current version has a basic command prompt with a few commands like the file table command which is `F`. For full documentation and changelog, you can look at the releases.

This is a picture of the main menu in latest release which is **0.1.0**.

And this is a graphics test which prints a 50x50 green square to the screen. There are many things you can do in Microbit but these are a few of them.
